    <p>
      Welcome to Cogitar (COH-jih-tahr), the Heart of Hiraeth (HEER-yth). This
      urban metropolis is a testament to humans and their growing ability, but
      that is how the Shadewalkers saw the world. Lightbearers knew the truth;
      fantastic beings began blending with this world, and only they could see
      the magic woven into the land. Advancements in technology, from the light
      switch that brings light to our houses to the intricate network in our
      mobile telecommunication devices, are all manifestations of powerful magic
      users.

      <h3>When the Veil Tore Open</h3>
      <p>
        It has been quite some time. Many still remember the day the boundary
        tore and the magic hidden among us was revealed. Humans obscured in the
        shade were forced to deal with a world larger than themselves all around
        them, while the beings bathed in the light had no choice but to
        collaborate with the magically deficient. Realms shattered, sending
        hundreds of thousands of beings into this one and sealing it away.
        Urgency made it important to work together as the fantastical creatures
        merged with the known world, as did their monsters and the following
        destruction. Creatures terrifying might sunder the land and eliminate
        much of society, leaving this as the last known bastion of civilization.
        Ignorance truly was bliss. We departed from the Ignolorian
        (ihg-NOH-lohr-ee-an) Era, the age of unknown horizons, and into what
        many consider the Melugium (Meh-LOO-zhee-uhm) Era, the age of restored
        balance.
      </p>
      <h3>Where we Now Stand</h3>
      <p>
        From the outside of the city, it is a paradise for society. Lands have
        been torn apart by the monsters that roamed the land without substantial
        forces to drive them away. Death and destruction worldwide remain a
        distance away from the great metropolis. Corogus (coh-ROH-guhs) sits
        center as the downtown district where all major business takes place and
        is the only access to the government district of Aeorza (a-YOR-zuh) to
        the east across a lone bridge suspended above the massive river.
        Grimhaven is the core of industrialism and factories north of the center
        and opposite Rheinshire (RINE-shi-er) to the south, where it remains
        expensive but worthy of staying. Those lucky enough to be closer to the
        center find their greatest concern being traffic, although nothing stops
        criminals from trying their hand at fortune. However, people living west
        of the city center in Orion Heights are left with less than suitable
        living conditions. This is particularly true the further out one finds
        themselves of Grimhaven and Rheinshire. Safety exists as a wall at the
        edge, a boundary, and a symbol for what remains.

      <h1>The Pulse of the Heartland</h1>
      <h3>Cogitar Metropolis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Key Slogan: “Lucet [in] Tenebris, Obscurat [in] Luce” - Shine in
          Darkness, Dim in Light
        </li>
        <li>Common Saying: “Infinitus Terminus” - An Infinite Limit</li>
        <li>Demonym: Cogitarian</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This metropolis is comparable to the great cities on “Earth,” known as
        New York, Tokyo, London, and Mexico City, as a cultural center of many
        civilizations. A connection of elevated railways that move from the
        center outward to other districts and return throughout the greater
        metropolis. This allows four of the five major divisions of the
        metropolis to be interconnected.
      </p>

      <h4>Corogus Province</h4>
      <p>
        Central Cogitar. The pinnacle of Cogitar, sometimes called the “Pulse of
        the Heartland,” Corogus is the region's capital and economic center.
        Lethodaj (LEH-thoh-daaj) is a ruin located beneath the Corogus Province,
        which was once named Cogitar before the expansions. The ruins have been
        built upon since the devastation that shook the land, as it was easier
        than attempting to repair the entirety of the old city. This underground
        city is used mainly to navigate underneath the city through unique
        tunnels for the train system and other highways that weave through the
        remains.
      </p>

      <h4>Grimhaven Prefecture</h4>
      <p>
        Northern Cogitar. Once named Green Haven, the Grimhaven prefecture has
        fallen with increased industrial exploitation along the Quenching River
        that separates this prefecture from the Corogus province. Factories
        caused the land and water to become polluted, and aid disparity
        increased further in the prefecture. The Asphodel Meadows is in cold
        marshes and frozen mountains north of the prefecture border.
      </p>

      <h4>Rheinshire Prefecture</h4>
      <p>
        Southern Cogitar. Primarily a commercial zone that handles financial
        operations separate from Corogus, Rhineshire is dedicated to a
        middle-class living. Additionally, this prefecture boasts grand artistic
        expressions and prominent education outside of Aeorza. The economic
        success comes from the expressive entertainment of the beautiful Des
        Fluat River that separates this prefecture from the Corogus province.
        The Kardian Fields are located south beyond the prefecture borders into
        cool valleys and tropical jungles.
      </p>

      <h4>Orion Heights Parish</h4>
      <p>
        Western Cogitar. Beyond the Carotide Mountain Range to the west of the
        Corogus Province is the expansive Orion Heights parish. This area is
        commercially separate from the central province and prefectures due to
        the mountains. It holds a residential significance for individuals who
        live away from the main cities. Orion Heights is west of the Corogus
        Province, separated by the Carotide (KAAR-oh-tide) Mountain Range. The
        Lucean (LOO-zhn) Vista is located further west beyond the limits of the
        parish into a warm desert and rough terrain.
      </p>

      <h4>Aeorza Parish</h4>
      <p>
        Eastern Cogitar East of the mainland is the Sternus Sea which Cymbalom
        (sim-BAA-luhm) Island settles, connected by the Athriel Bridge. The
        island sits in the Aeorza parish, where prominent members of society
        swell away from the hassle of the cities. Private companies, special
        education facilities, and other government subsidies municipalities
        primarily operate in this parish.
      </p>

      <h2>Serve the Heart, Sacrifice your Life</h2>
      <p>
        Individuals who find themselves called to greater actions to maintain
        the integrity of civilization are drawn to the Diamond League of
        Transcendental Uniformed Soldiers, referred to as the Diamond LOTUS. All
        who wish to follow this path enter the Grim Academy for Rendering
        Dangerous Entities Neutral, the GARDEN, as Seedlings to graduate into
        the Diamond LOTUS. Graduating at the top of the class means that a
        Seedling joins the Ruby Guard, a military police meant to enforce law
        and order within the city dressed in red like the city's blood. The
        remaining graduates can join the Sapphire Guard, the forces in charge of
        maintaining the district borders, but, more importantly, station
        themselves along the city's boundaries. Graduates unable to meet the
        requirements or choose not to follow the prestigious guard are left to
        the Emerald Guard. The Emerald Guard dedicate their efforts to exploring
        the lands beyond the city's boundary to discover hope.

      <h1>To Evolve is to Survive</h1>
      <p>
        Magic and technology may be synonymous in functionality. Here, aether is
        manipulated by those with an inherent ability to alter the raw forces
        and produce extraordinary results in Conduits. The archaic definition of
        this power is known as Spells. Aether (A-thr) is considered the life
        force of all things within this realm and the threads that bind it to
        others, and it is the ability to produce unique effects by shaping and
        converting this energy into tangible effects in our world. The process
        of manipulating raw Aether is referred to as Aether Crafting,
        archaically defined as Spellcasting as the individual creates a Conduit
        or the method in which the transition from raw energy into the desired
        outcome. This force is manifested in many ways, being a spell for those
        that study, being a power for those that inherit the power, or being a
        resource to amplify one’s natural potential. There is no difference
        between what an Aether Crafter and a Spell Caster do, but a distinction
        is a contextual approach. Individuals who can manipulate aether and
        produce magical effects are akin to Spell Casters. When a machine or
        device of artifice can manipulate aether to produce magical effects,
        used by an automated machine or controlled by an individual, it is akin
        to an Aether Crafter.
      </p>
      <h2>Industries of Aether</h2>
      <p>
        Magic have been defined in a way that has always been understood and
        studied, hence the application of schools of magic. However, the
        development of society and advancements in technology in various places
        manifested new industries. This became a blend of the artisan guilds
        over time with the inclusion of magic in their work. Conduits are
        classified into eight categories commonly referred to as industries.
        Corporate researchers, ancient scholars, and general studies regarding
        conduits apply these classifications to all functions of aether
        crafting, no matter the source, application, or source of power.
      </p>
      <h3>Corporate Pantheons</h3>
      <p>
        Mercantile services have been a factor of society for centuries, as
        people trade goods and services. With the establishment of an advanced
        society and the industrialization of communities, business operations
        became more commercialized, favoring guilds rather than traditional
        shops and markets. This led to major guilds expanding their reach and
        functions to aim for control over a specific market. Still, the major
        shift came with the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations. With the
        development of Aether Crafting, taking the raw energy that was used to
        make magical effects and creating artificial magical conduits as an
        alternative, the traditional markets were being dominated by a series of
        aether crafters who used this fake spell casting to make what many
        worked tirelessly to do. As such, specific wizards changed their
        trajectory from being court wizards to creating their own companies and,
        over time, evolved into corporations. The Figure-Eight Fortune
        Corporations are the companies specifically founded by a wizard, whether
        or not the current company still operates with the wizard in charge or
        if it is the original company that was founded.
      </p>
      <h4>Communication</h4>
      <p>
        Divination. The industry originally developed to establish long-form
        convenient communication via radio, phones, and global positioning

        Corporations specializing in Communication, discovering a way to
        manifest a demiplane of information.
      </p>
      <h4>Energy</h4>
      <p>
        Evocation. The industry was originally developed to provide
        long-standing renewable energy by extrapolating raw aether. This process
        generates the ability to shape and mold the basic elements of life for
        increased sustained power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prometheus Power is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations
        specializing in Energy, creating the Aether Cell (and Aether Batteries)
        used as portable energy sources to maintain developing technologies.
      </p>
      <h4>Entertainment</h4>
      <p>
        Illusion. The industry was originally designed to pass tradition through
        various forms of storytelling and developed further as a method to
        deceive the senses or minds of others. The nature of the creative
        aspects distracts the mind from what is real, and the industry's
        evolution allowed these false creations to become tangible and affect
        reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ambrosia Garden Entertainment Network (AGEN) is one of the
        Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations specializing in Entertainment,
        mastering a unique control over minor Faerie forces.
      </p>
      <h4>Healthcare</h4>
      <p>
        Necromancy. The industry was originally established to sustain the life
        force of organic creatures. Using the manipulation of life essence to
        reduce or promote health and disease. The industry's evolution brought
        about the ability to prevent death and even provide life to the fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Matrona Medical Group is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune
        Corporations specializing in Healthcare, establishing control over
        unique rejuvenation forces in collaboration with Divine entities.
      </p>
      <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
      <p>
        Transmutation. The industry was originally developed to aid in the mass
        production of resources generated from raw materials. The ability to
        transform one form of raw material, including organic material, into a
        large-scale production. These transformations include the ability to
        make objects move by sheer will, enhance the ability of an organic
        creature, or simply change the property of the environment.
      </p>
      <p>

        of the metropolis, including the boundary walls.
      </p>
      <h4>Marketing</h4>
      <p>
        Enchantment. The most recently established industry is designed to focus
        on the ability to influence the thoughts and decisions that impact an
        individual’s behavior. The evolution of this industry pushed the
        potential of forcing individuals to behave in a specific manner, such as
        finding a particular creature more familiar, generating hostility, and
        even causing one to become a puppet to a marketing choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Syreno Holdings is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations
        specializing in Marketing, creating the Syreno (SEE-ruh-noh) Resort and
        Spa that provides luxurious retreats across the region and directly
        supports the Emerald Guard to establish remote destinations.
      </p>
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>
        Abjuration. The industry was formed to protect individuals and assets
        through dedicated defenses and aggressive uses. This industry evolved
        into establishing powerful barriers, neutralizing potential effects,
        debilitating trespassers, and evacuating foreign entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hypnic Operations is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations
        specializing in Security, rivaling the Diamond LOTUS.
      </p>
      <h4>Transportation</h4>

        Transportation, creating the “Jump” pads allowing for teleportation
        across the massive metropolis.
      </p>

      <h4>Lesser Corporate Pantheons</h4>
      <p>
        The world is full of businesses, from individuals selling from carts on
        the streets, family businesses, and a group or guild selling on large
        scales. Still, only a select number of organizations chose to file
        articles of incorporation and gain the support of local government to
        enhance their operations. There are dozens of other business
        organizations; however, not all have become incorporated, and even those
        that have may not be filled with enough notoriety to be nationally
        recognized even if they are locally popular. Here are some of the most
        prominent corporations in Cogitar considered part of the lesser
        corporate pantheons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

      <h1>Player's Guide</h1>
      <p>
        The Horizon Boundary was a magical phenomenon where people could see and
        manipulate their magic (Lightbearers) and others who could not
        (Shadewalkers). Shadewalkers lived unaware of the magic around them and
        even in themselves. Elves would walk around, and everyone would see them
        as another human, just as they saw themselves. Lightbearers saw the
        truth, observing as a dragon would soar through the sky above the Ferris
        wheel or seeing the sea elf that could sit at the bottom of a pool
        unbothered for an extraordinarily long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly a century ago, the Horizon Boundary cracked, and the truth became
        evident for everyone to witness. Chaos ran through the streets as people
        with magical lineage unleashed their truth, and the very fabric of
        society began to crumble. However, their differences and concerns were
        put aside as the continued fracturing of the boundary caused other
        realms, dimensions, and universes to collapse onto this one. Not only
        had people revealed their magical lineage, but creatures from foreign
        lands were thrust upon this one forcing magic where even Shadewalkers
        suddenly bore powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual problem was not the people that came but the monsters that
        shared their homeland. Monsters across the multiverse found their way to
        this world of Hiraeth, and the apocalypse was all but certain. Armies
        faced the forces of darkness encroaching on the land and were quickly
        overwhelmed as civilization dwindled. By chance, a small party found a
        way to enter the Horizon Boundary and barricade the fracture. Their
        efforts allowed the fragments of society to gather themselves and settle
        in the metropolis of Cogitar.
      </p>
      <p>This is where your story takes place.</p>
      <p>
        The city has provided comfort for those living near the center, away
        from the fear of what comes by land, and the eastern sea remains ever
        calm so long as one does not sail beyond the sight of land.
        Nevertheless, portions of the city face a threat from what evil lingers
        along the outlands beyond the fortified walls and still deal with the
        strife of an overpopulated region eating away at itself.
