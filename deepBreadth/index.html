        <h2>WELCOME TO DEEP BREADTH</h2>
        <p>
          Prepare to walk the streets of a modern world filled with technology
          while still wielding wondrous magic powers.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Welcome to Cogitar (COH-jih-tahr), the Heart of Hiraeth (HEER-yth)
        </h3>
        <p>
          This urban metropolis is a testament to humans and their growing
          ability, but that is how the Shadewalkers saw the world. Lightbearers
          knew the truth; fantastic beings began blending with this world, and
          only they could see the magic woven into the land. Advancements in
          technology, from the light switch that brings light to our houses to
          the intricate network in our mobile telecommunication devices, are all
          manifestations of powerful magic users.
        </p>
        <h3>When the Veil Tore Open</h3>
        <p>
          It has been quite some time. Many still remember the day the boundary
          tore and the magic hidden among us was revealed. Humans obscured in
          the shade were forced to deal with a world larger than themselves all
          around them, while the beings bathed in the light had no choice but to
          collaborate with the magically deficient. Realms shattered, sending
          hundreds of thousands of beings into this one and sealing it away.
          Urgency made it important to work together as the fantastical
          creatures merged with the known world, as did their monsters and the
          following destruction. Creatures terrifying might sunder the land and
          eliminate much of society, leaving this as the last known bastion of
          civilization. Ignorance truly was bliss. We departed from the
          Ignolorian (ihg-NOH-lohr-ee-an) Era, the age of unknown horizons, and
          into what many consider the Melugium (Meh-LOO-zhee-uhm) Era, the age
          of restored balance.
        </p>
        <h3>Where We Now Stand</h3>
        <p>
          From the outside of the city, it is a paradise for society. Lands have
          been torn apart by the monsters that roamed the land without
          substantial forces to drive them away. Death and destruction worldwide
          remain a distance away from the great metropolis. Corogus
          (coh-ROH-guhs) sits center as the downtown district where all major
          business takes place and is the only access to the government district
          of Aeorza (a-YOR-zuh) to the east across a lone bridge suspended above
          the massive river. Grimhaven is the core of industrialism and
          factories north of the center and opposite Rheinshire (RINE-shi-er) to
          the south, where it remains expensive but worthy of staying. Those
          lucky enough to be closer to the center find their greatest concern
          being traffic, although nothing stops criminals from trying their hand
          at fortune. However, people living west of the city center in Orion
          Heights are left with less than suitable living conditions. This is
          particularly true the further out one finds themselves of Grimhaven
          and Rheinshire. Safety exists as a wall at the edge, a boundary, and a
          symbol for what remains.
        </p>
        <h2>THE PULSE OF THE HEARTLAND</h2>
        <h3>Cogitar Metropolis</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Slogan:</strong> “Lucet [in] Tenebris, Obscurat [in] Luce”
          - Shine in Darkness, Dim in Light
          <br />
          <strong>Common Saying:</strong> “Infinitus Terminus” - An Infinite
          Limit
          <br />
          <strong>Demonym:</strong> Cogitarian
          <br />
          This metropolis is comparable to the great cities on “Earth,” known as
          New York, Tokyo, London, and Mexico City, as a cultural center of many
          civilizations. A connection of elevated railways that move from the
          center outward to other districts and return throughout the greater
          metropolis. This allows four of the five major divisions of the
          metropolis to be interconnected.
        </p>
        <h3>Corogus Province</h3>
        <p>
          Central Cogitar
          <br />
          The pinnacle of Cogitar, sometimes called the “Pulse of the
          Heartland,” Corogus is the region's capital and economic center.
          Lethodaj (LEH-thoh-daaj) is a ruin located beneath the Corogus
          Province, which was once named Cogitar before the expansions. The
          ruins have been built upon since the devastation that shook the land,
          as it was easier than attempting to repair the entirety of the old
          city. This underground city is used mainly to navigate underneath the
          city through unique tunnels for the train system and other highways
          that weave through the remains.
        </p>
        <h3>Grimhaven Prefecture</h3>
        <p>
          Northern Cogitar
          <br />
          Once named Green Haven, the Grimhaven prefecture has fallen with
          increased industrial exploitation along the Quenching River that
          separates this prefecture from the Corogus province. Factories caused
          the land and water to become polluted, and aid disparity increased
          further in the prefecture. The Asphodel Meadows is in cold marshes and
          frozen mountains north of the prefecture border.
        </p>
        <h3>Rheinshire Prefecture</h3>
        <p>
          Southern Cogitar
          <br />
          Primarily a commercial zone that handles financial operations separate
          from Corogus, Rhineshire is dedicated to a middle-class living.
          Additionally, this prefecture boasts grand artistic expressions and
          prominent education outside of Aeorza. The economic success comes from
          the expressive entertainment of the beautiful Des Fluat River that
          separates this prefecture from the Corogus province. The Kardian
          Fields are located south beyond the prefecture borders into cool
          valleys and tropical jungles.
        </p>
        <h3>Orion Heights Parish</h3>
        <p>
          Western Cogitar
          <br />
          Beyond the Carotide Mountain Range to the west of the Corogus Province
          is the expansive Orion Heights parish. This area is commercially
          separate from the central province and prefectures due to the
          mountains. It holds a residential significance for individuals who
          live away from the main cities. Orion Heights is west of the Corogus
          Province, separated by the Carotide (KAAR-oh-tide) Mountain Range. The
          Lucean (LOO-zhn) Vista is located further west beyond the limits of
          the parish into a warm desert and rough terrain.
        </p>
        <h3>Aeorza Parish</h3>
        <p>
          Eastern Cogitar
          <br />
          East of the mainland is the Sternus Sea which Cymbalom (sim-BAA-luhm)
          Island settles, connected by the Athriel Bridge. The island sits in
          the Aeorza parish, where prominent members of society swell away from
          the hassle of the cities. Private companies, special education
          facilities, and other government subsidies municipalities primarily
          operate in this parish.
        </p>
        <h3>Serve the Heart, Sacrifice your Life</h3>
        <p>
          Individuals who find themselves called to greater actions to maintain
          the integrity of civilization are drawn to the Diamond League of
          Transcendental Uniformed Soldiers, referred to as the Diamond LOTUS.
          All who wish to follow this path enter the Grim Academy for Rendering
          Dangerous Entities Neutral, the GARDEN, as Seedlings to graduate into
          the Diamond LOTUS. Graduating at the top of the class means that a
          Seedling joins the Ruby Guard, a military police meant to enforce law
          and order within the city dressed in red like the city's blood. The
          remaining graduates can join the Sapphire Guard, the forces in charge
          of maintaining the district borders, but, more importantly, station
          themselves along the city's boundaries. Graduates unable to meet the
          requirements or choose not to follow the prestigious guard are left to
          the Emerald Guard. The Emerald Guard dedicate their efforts to
          exploring the lands beyond the city's boundary to discover hope.
        </p>
        <h3>To Evolve is to Survive</h3>
        <p>
          Magic and technology may be synonymous in functionality. Here, aether
          is manipulated by those with an inherent ability to alter the raw
          forces and produce extraordinary results in Conduits. The archaic
          definition of this power is known as Spells. Aether (A-thr) is
          considered the life force of all things within this realm and the
          threads that bind it to others, and it is the ability to produce
          unique effects by shaping and converting this energy into tangible
          effects in our world. The process of manipulating raw Aether is
          referred to as Aether Crafting, archaically defined as Spellcasting as
          the individual creates a Conduit or the method in which the transition
          from raw energy into the desired outcome. This force is manifested in
          many ways, being a spell for those that study, being a power for those
          that inherit the power, or being a resource to amplify one’s natural
          potential. There is no difference between what an Aether Crafter and a
          Spell Caster do, but a distinction is a contextual approach.
          Individuals who can manipulate aether and produce magical effects are
          akin to Spell Casters. When a machine or device of artifice can
          manipulate aether to produce magical effects, used by an automated
          machine or controlled by an individual, it is akin to an Aether
          Crafter.
        </p>
        <h3>Industries of Aether</h3>
        <p>
          Magic have been defined in a way that has always been understood and
          studied, hence the application of schools of magic. However, the
          development of society and advancements in technology in various
          places manifested new industries. This became a blend of the artisan
          guilds over time with the inclusion of magic in their work. Conduits
          are classified into eight categories commonly referred to as
          industries. Corporate researchers, ancient scholars, and general
          studies regarding conduits apply these classifications to all
          functions of aether crafting, no matter the source, application, or
          source of power.
        </p>
        <h3>Corporate Pantheons</h3>
        <p>
          Mercantile services have been a factor of society for centuries, as
          people trade goods and services. With the establishment of an advanced
          society and the industrialization of communities, business operations
          became more commercialized, favoring guilds rather than traditional
          shops and markets. This led to major guilds expanding their reach and
          functions to aim for control over a specific market. Still, the major
          shift came with the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations. With the
          development of Aether Crafting, taking the raw energy that was used to
          make magical effects and creating artificial magical conduits as an
          alternative, the traditional markets were being dominated by a series
          of aether crafters who used this fake spell casting to make what many
          worked tirelessly to do. As such, specific wizards changed their
          trajectory from being court wizards to creating their own companies
          and, over time, evolved into corporations. The Figure-Eight Fortune
          Corporations are the companies specifically founded by a wizard,
          whether or not the current company still operates with the wizard in
          charge or if it is the original company that was founded.
        </p>
        <h4>Communication - Divination</h4>
        <p>
          The industry originally developed to establish long-form convenient
          communication via radio, phones, and global positioning systems. The
          industry's evolution has established conduits that reveal hidden
          objects or information, whether physical or metaphysical. The Aether
          Communication Tower (ACT) is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune
          Corporations specializing in Communication, discovering a way to
          manifest a demiplane of information.
        </p>
        <h4>Energy - Evocation</h4>
        <p>
          The industry was originally developed to provide long-standing
          renewable energy by extrapolating raw aether. This process generates
          the ability to shape and mold the basic elements of life for increased
          sustained power. Prometheus Power is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune
          Corporations specializing in Energy, creating the Aether Cell (and
          Aether Batteries) used as portable energy sources to maintain
          developing technologies.
        </p>
        <h4>Entertainment - Illusion</h4>
        <p>
          The industry was originally designed to pass tradition through various
          forms of storytelling and developed further as a method to deceive the
          senses or minds of others. The nature of the creative aspects
          distracts the mind from what is real, and the industry's evolution
          allowed these false creations to become tangible and affect reality.
          The Ambrosia Garden Entertainment Network (AGEN) is one of the
          Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations specializing in Entertainment,
          mastering a unique control over minor Faerie forces.
        </p>
        <h4>Healthcare - Necromancy</h4>
        <p>
          The industry was originally established to sustain the life force of
          organic creatures. Using the manipulation of life essence to reduce or
          promote health and disease. The industry's evolution brought about the
          ability to prevent death and even provide life to the fallen. The
          Matrona Medical Group is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations
          specializing in Healthcare, establishing control over unique
          rejuvenation forces in collaboration with Divine entities.
        </p>
        <h4>Manufacturing - Transmutation</h4>
        <p>
          The industry was originally developed to aid in the mass production of
          resources generated from raw materials. The ability to transform one
          form of raw material, including organic material, into a large-scale
          production. These transformations include the ability to make objects
          move by sheer will, enhance the ability of an organic creature, or
          simply change the property of the environment. Heartbeat Construction
          is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations specializing in
          Manufacturing, handling much of the core infrastructure of the
          metropolis, including the boundary walls.
        </p>
        <h4>Marketing - Enchantment</h4>
        <p>
          The most recently established industry is designed to focus on the
          ability to influence the thoughts and decisions that impact an
          individual’s behavior. The evolution of this industry pushed the
          potential of forcing individuals to behave in a specific manner, such
          as finding a particular creature more familiar, generating hostility,
          and even causing one to become a puppet to a marketing choice. Syrena
          Holdings is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations specializing
          in Marketing, creating the Syreno (SEE-ruh-noh) Resort and Spa that
          provides luxurious retreats across the region and directly supports
          the Emerald Guard to establish remote destinations.
        </p>
        <h4>Security - Abjuration</h4>
        <p>
          The industry was formed to protect individuals and assets through
          dedicated defenses and aggressive uses. This industry evolved into
          establishing powerful barriers, neutralizing potential effects,
          debilitating trespassers, and evacuating foreign entities. Hypnic
          Operations is one of the Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations
          specializing in Security, rivaling the Diamond LOTUS.
        </p>
        <h4>Transportation - Conjuration</h4>
        <p>
          The industry was developed to aid in transporting objects and
          creatures from one location to another. This industry evolved to the
          potential of pulling objects and creatures from unknown realms,
          seemingly manifesting substance from nothing. Jump is one of the
          Figure-Eight Fortune Corporations specializing in Transportation,
          creating the “Jump” pads allowing for teleportation across the massive
          metropolis.
        </p>
        <h3>Lesser Corporate Pantheons</h3>
        <p>
          The world is full of businesses, from individuals selling from carts
          on the streets, family businesses, and a group or guild selling on
          large scales. Still, only a select number of organizations chose to
          file articles of incorporation and gain the support of local
          government to enhance their operations. There are dozens of other
          business organizations; however, not all have become incorporated, and
          even those that have may not be filled with enough notoriety to be
          nationally recognized even if they are locally popular. Here are some
          of the most prominent corporations in Cogitar considered part of the
          lesser corporate pantheons. Aurum Reserves. Cogitar established a
          widespread banking system integrated with the treasury. Permits the
          use of a unique currency management system which includes the direct
          function of Charge Cards. – “The New Gold Standard” was founded by
          Lazlo and Gabrantha. Hortisun. A collection of green-focused
          enthusiasts that strive to create healthy vegetation despite the
          attempt of society to continue evolving and tearing through limited
          land resources. – “A Greener Tomorrow, Today” was founded by various
          druid circles. Inoscular. A fashion enterprise that focuses on reduced
          waste and upcycling, using natural materials to make clothing that can
          be recycled for the newest fashion. – “Naturally Stylish” was founded
          by the druid Daedalus. Hemion Herald. A premier delivery service is
          used for most post requests choosing to avoid government-provided
          programs. They specialize in delivering to locations where Jump pads
          are unavailable and supplement with custom newsprints. – “Unstoppable.
          Unbeatable” was founded by delivery person Hemion. The Sentinel. A
          prolific news network through broadcasting and articles available on
          demand. Not a fan favorite and influenced by the government, they
          boast 24 Hours news cycle. – “Vigilant News, Always.
        </p>
        <h2>Player’s Guide</h2>
        <p>
          The Horizon Boundary was a magical phenomenon where people could see
          and manipulate their magic (Lightbearers) and others who could not
          (Shadewalkers). Shadewalkers lived unaware of the magic around them
          and even in themselves. Elves would walk around, and everyone would
          see them as another human, just as they saw themselves. Lightbearers
          saw the truth, observing as a dragon would soar through the sky above
          the Ferris wheel or seeing the sea elf that could sit at the bottom of
          a pool unbothered for an extraordinarily long time. Nearly a century
          ago, the Horizon Boundary cracked, and the truth became evident for
          everyone to witness. Chaos ran through the streets as people with
          magical lineage unleashed their truth, and the very fabric of society
          began to crumble. However, their differences and concerns were put
          aside as the continued fracturing of the boundary caused other realms,
          dimensions, and universes to collapse onto this one. Not only had
          people revealed their magical lineage, but creatures from foreign
          lands were thrust upon this one forcing magic where even Shadewalkers
          suddenly bore powers. The actual problem was not the people that came
          but the monsters that shared their homeland. Monsters across the
          multiverse found their way to this world of Hiraeth, and the
          apocalypse was all but certain. Armies faced the forces of darkness
          encroaching on the land and were quickly overwhelmed as civilization
          dwindled. By chance, a small party found a way to enter the Horizon
          Boundary and barricade the fracture. Their efforts allowed the
          fragments of society to gather themselves and settle in the metropolis
          of Cogitar. This is where your story takes place. The city has
          provided comfort for those living near the center, away from the fear
          of what comes by land, and the eastern sea remains ever calm so long
          as one does not sail beyond the sight of land. Nevertheless, portions
          of the city face a threat from what evil lingers along the outlands
          beyond the fortified walls and still deal with the strife of an
          overpopulated region eating away at itself.

        <h3>Natural 20s</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Critical Hit.</strong> If you roll a natural 20 on the dice on
          an attack roll, the damage is Maximum + Roll. This means you assume
          the maximum damage you can deal with the attack, then roll the dice
          and add those values together.
          <br />
          <em>EX.</em> A shortsword attack (DEX 14 [+2]) makes a critical hit.
          The maximum damage can be dealt is 8 (1d6 + 2). You roll the d6 and
          get a 4. The total damage for the critical hit is 12 (8 + 4). If the
          attack included a sneak attack [4d6]. Then the damage would include 24
          (4d6) and a dice roll. Assuming the sneak attack rolled 12. Then the
          total damage of the critical hit with the sneak attack is 48 (8 + 4 +
          24 + 12). This applies to all damage dice rolled for the attack (such
          as a Paladin’s Smite, Ranger’s Hunter’s Mark, or a Warlock’s Hex).
          <br />
          <strong>Ability Check.</strong> If you roll a natural 20 on the dice
          for an ability check, it may not guarantee success, but magic is
          unpredictable, and you will benefit from a spell relevant to the
          check.
          <br />
          <em>EX.</em> You roll a natural 20 on the dice for an Intelligence
          (Investigation) check to look for traps. You find a specific trap, and
          you may gain the benefits of the find traps spell.
        </p>
        <h3>Healing Potions</h3>
        <p>
          When using a healing potion or similar items that provide benefits
          with a roll, there are two ways to do it.
          <br />
          <strong>Action.</strong> You can use the potion, gaining the full
          benefits of the healing (Healing potion normally provides 2d4 + 2
          healing. Rather than rolling, you automatically gain 10 points of
          healing).
          <br />
          <strong>Bonus Action.</strong> You can quickly use the potion, rolling
          the dice to determine healing as normal.
          <br />
          Using a potion on another character requires one action and will
          always require a roll.
